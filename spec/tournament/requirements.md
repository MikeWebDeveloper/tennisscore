# Tournament Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines requirements for implementing tournament management functionality within the tennis scoring application. The system will support single and doubles tournaments with up to 64 players, utilizing external bracket screenshots and Google Sheets integration for player data, while leveraging the existing match scoring infrastructure.

## Requirements

1. **Tournament Creation**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to create a new tournament with basic configuration, so that I can set up competitive events with proper format and participant limits.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When a user accesses tournament creation, the system shall provide fields for tournament name, format selection (singles/doubles), maximum participants (up to 64), and tournament date with validation.

2. **Player Data Integration**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want players to be loaded automatically from Google Sheets, so that I can avoid manual data entry and ensure accurate participant information.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When creating a tournament, the system shall fetch player data (name, surname, year of birth, ranking) from a configured Google Sheets endpoint and display available players for selection.

3. **Bracket Screenshot Upload**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to upload a screenshot of the tournament bracket from external software, so that I can reference the official tournament structure.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: While setting up a tournament, when uploading a bracket image, the system shall accept common image formats (PNG, JPG, PDF) up to 10MB and store them securely for tournament reference.

4. **Match Generation from Bracket**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to manually create matches based on the uploaded bracket, so that tournament progression can be tracked within our scoring system.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When viewing an uploaded bracket screenshot, the system shall provide an interface to manually define match pairings that correspond to the bracket structure, creating match records in the database.

5. **Tournament Match Scoring Integration**
   - **User Story**: As a match participant, I want to score tournament matches using the existing scoring interface, so that I can use familiar functionality while participating in tournaments.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When accessing a tournament match, the system shall launch the existing live scoring interface with match results automatically linked to tournament progression tracking.

6. **Tournament Match Management**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to view and manage all tournament matches, so that I can track progress and handle administrative tasks.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: While viewing a tournament, the system shall display all matches with their current status (pending, in progress, completed) and allow organizers to access match details and results.

7. **Tournament Player Selection**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to select specific players from the Google Sheets data for tournament participation, so that I can control who participates in each event.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When setting up tournament participants, the system shall display all available players from Google Sheets with search and filter capabilities, allowing selection up to the maximum tournament capacity.

8. **Tournament Configuration Storage**
   - **User Story**: As a system administrator, I want tournament configuration to be extensible, so that future enhancements like Google Sheets endpoints can be easily added.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When implementing tournament functionality, the system shall use a flexible configuration structure that allows for future addition of API endpoints, data sources, and tournament parameters.

9. **Tournament Status Tracking**
   - **User Story**: As a tournament participant or organizer, I want to view tournament progress and standings, so that I can understand current competition status.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: While viewing a tournament, the system shall display completed matches, current standings based on wins/losses, and upcoming matches with clear visual indicators.

10. **Tournament Archive**
    - **User Story**: As a tournament organizer, I want to maintain historical tournament records, so that I can reference past events and track player performance over time.
