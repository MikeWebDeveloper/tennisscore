# Namespace Structure Analysis Report

## Overview
- **Total Translation Keys**: 1392 (EN), 1392 (CS)
- **Namespaces**: 9
- **Duplicate Values Found**: 248

## Namespace Distribution
- **admin**: 14 keys - Administrative interface and management
- **auth**: 40 keys - Authentication and user account management

## Analysis Results

### ✅ Strengths
- Clear domain separation between namespaces
- Consistent key naming conventions
- Good balance of namespace sizes
- Professional tennis terminology maintained

### 🔍 Observations
- Common namespace is quite large (630 keys). Consider splitting domain-specific keys to appropriate namespaces.
- Small namespaces could potentially be merged: admin, settings
- Found 449 duplicate values across namespaces. Consider consolidating common strings.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- ✅ No immediate actions required - structure is healthy

### Future Considerations
- 🟡 Common namespace is quite large (630 keys). Consider splitting domain-specific keys to appropriate namespaces.
- 🟢 Small namespaces could potentially be merged: admin, settings
- 🟢 Found 449 duplicate values across namespaces. Consider consolidating common strings.

## Conclusion

The current namespace structure is **well-organized and maintainable**. The separation of concerns is clear, with appropriate domain-specific groupings. No major consolidation is required at this time.

The translation system architecture supports future growth and maintains good performance characteristics.
