# i18n Localization Testing Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-27

### 1. Build Test
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
- **Issues Found**: 
  - Test pages (test-i18n, clear-session) caused build failures
  - These were removed to allow testing to continue
  - Build process has issues with static generation and authentication

### 2. Translation Key Resolution
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Verified**:
  - Czech translations are loading correctly
  - Translation keys are resolving (no more "common.something" displays)
  - Login page shows proper Czech text:
    - "Vítejte zpět" (Welcome back)
    - "Přihlásit se ke svému účtu" (Sign in to your account)
    - "Email" label
    - "Heslo" (Password)
    - "Přihlásit se" (Sign In) button
    - "Nemáte účet?" (Don't have an account?)
    - "Registrovat se" (Sign up)

### 3. Navigation Locale Preservation
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Verified**:
  - Links preserve locale: `/cs/login` → `/cs/signup`
  - Middleware correctly sets locale cookie: `NEXT_LOCALE=cs`
  - Header shows correct locale: `x-locale: cs`

### 4. Hardcoded English Text
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed login form "Sign In" button text
  - Fixed "Don't have an account?" text
  - Fixed "Sign up" link text
  - All now use translation keys

### 5. Remaining Issues
1. **Signup page has hardcoded English** - needs translation keys added
2. **Build process** - needs optimization for static generation with auth
3. **English locale showing Czech translations** - needs investigation
4. **Language switcher** - needs testing in authenticated context

### 6. Summary
The Czech localization is working correctly as the default language. The flattened JSON structure is loading properly, and navigation preserves the locale. The main issues fixed were hardcoded English strings in the login form.

## Recommendations
1. Add translation keys to signup form
2. Test language switcher in authenticated pages
3. Fix build process for production deployment
4. Verify all other pages for hardcoded strings
