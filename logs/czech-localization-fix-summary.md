# Czech Localization Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-27

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. JSON Structure Issues ✅
- **Problem**: All translation files had nested namespace wrappers (e.g., `{ "auth": { "signIn": "..." } }`)
- **Solution**: Removed outer namespace wrappers from all 16 translation files
- **Result**: Translations now load correctly with flattened structure

#### 2. Hardcoded English in Signup Form ✅
- **Problem**: SSR section of signup form had hardcoded English strings
- **Solution**: Updated all hardcoded strings to use translation keys
- **Files Updated**: `/src/app/[locale]/(auth)/signup/_components/signup-form.tsx`

#### 3. Hardcoded English in Match Export Dialog ✅
- **Problem**: Extensive hardcoded English strings throughout the component
- **Solution**: Replaced 40+ hardcoded strings with translation keys
- **Files Updated**: `/src/components/features/match-export-dialog.tsx`

#### 4. Missing Translation Keys ✅
- **Problem**: Many new translation keys were needed but didn't exist
- **Solution**: Added 48 new translation keys to both English and Czech files
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `/src/i18n/locales/en/common.json`
  - `/src/i18n/locales/cs/common.json`
