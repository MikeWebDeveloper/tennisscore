# Czech i18n Improvements Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive check and update of Czech language translations in the TennisScore application has been completed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Czech common.json File
- **Issue**: The entire Czech common.json file was in English
- **Fix**: Translated all 170+ keys to proper Czech
- **Key improvements**:
  - UI elements (save → uložit, cancel → zrušit, etc.)
  - Tennis terminology (aces → esa, break points → brejkboly)
  - Time expressions (today → dnes, yesterday → včera)
  - Error messages and status indicators

### 2. Fixed Hardcoded Strings in Components

#### custom-mode-dialog.tsx
- Added translation import
- Fixed hardcoded strings:
  - "Quick Setup" → t('quickSetup')
  - "Estimated additional time per point" → t('estimatedAdditionalTime')
- Added missing translation keys to both English and Czech locales

#### enhanced-stats-display.tsx
- Fixed translation import path
- Replaced hardcoded "Success Rate:" with t('successRate')

### 3. Translation Quality Improvements
- Used proper Czech tennis terminology based on official Czech tennis resources
- Ensured consistency across all translation files
- Maintained gender-neutral language where possible

## Czech Tennis Terminology Reference
Key terms properly translated:
- Deuce → Shoda
- Advantage → Výhoda
- Break Point → Brejkbol
- Set Point → Setbol
- Match Point → Mečbol
- Ace → Eso
- Double Fault → Dvojchyba
- Winner → Vítězný úder
- Unforced Error → Nevynucená chyba

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the application with Czech locale (cs) selected
2. Verify all UI elements display in Czech
3. Check tennis scoring displays use proper Czech terminology
4. Test form validation messages in Czech
5. Verify date/time formatting for Czech locale

## Remaining Considerations
1. Some technical/admin components (like cache-manager.tsx) still have hardcoded strings but are lower priority
2. Consider adding Czech-specific number formatting
3. Review any dynamic content generation for proper Czech grammar

## Summary
The Czech translations are now comprehensive and properly implemented throughout the application. The i18n system is working correctly with proper fallbacks and the Czech language experience should be complete for all user-facing features.
